Hello all!

This is the code to my personal website. 
You may find it a bit odd that I'm including it here on github for all to see, but frankly, I think that's how it ought to be!!!
I work with rails and Mootools and am working daily to learn enough about each to become part of the the communities, respectively.

In this website, you'll find that I work with the rails mootool driver to make all of my js unobtrusive.  
You can also find some cool things I'm working on hacking up like a persistent header plugin for mootools that I couldn't seem to find anywhere else.

My goal is to make all of the code I write available to anyone to enrich the open source community.

Feel free to look around and steal any ideas as you will.  If you end up using a plugin found here, don't be afraid to give some credit :)

Good luck hacking,
Austin
